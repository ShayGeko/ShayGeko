I'm a 4th year CS student at Simon Fraser University. I am also the President of SFU Competitive Programming Club, currently working towards getting to North-American Championship and (hopefully) the World Finals in ICPC. I am passionate about innovation, algorithms development, AI and supporting communities through technology.


## üèóÔ∏è Current project

![project demo](https://github.com/ShayGeko/ShayGeko/blob/main/current_project_demo.png?raw=true)

Ever wanted to create a leetcode study group, or see how good are you doing compared to your friends? Are you a competitive programmer that solves problems on many different platforms and would like a single place to view your stats and stats of your friends? 
That's what Codegram is all about!
